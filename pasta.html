                        <p>I saw Flying Lotus at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, 
                        but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.</p>
                        <p>He said, “Oh, like you’re doing <em>now</em>?”</p>
                        <p>I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing
                        his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle
                        as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen 
                        Milky Ways in his hands without paying.</p>
                        <p>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.”
                        At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the
                        counter.</p>
                        <p>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each
                        individually “to prevent any <em>electrical infetterence</em>,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think
                        that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting
                        her by yawning really loudly</p>
